# GFG-DSA with Python

I will be writing theory explaination , implmentation and problems based on each section as mentioned in the GFG DSA with python course

I will be using **Jupyter Notebook** as IDE

## My Functions

`imp_personal.py` function Created by me 

It has numerous features, including 
* Creating Markdown comments and a link that allows you to visit the topic from the top of the page.
* Except for `.new()` all executed commands will be removed when the cell is run.

`watcher.py` : The name is merely a watcher, but he can do so much.

* Keep an eye on the updates or add a new function (only do something when there is any changes related to functions This I have deleberately chosen.)
* When the file is changed, do git procedures.
* Operations such as
    * `git add`
    * `git commit`
    * `git push`
 * This operations only execute when there is a Change in Function or when function is newly created.
 * Also Added Colored logs to show different output logs
