# GFG-DSA with Python

`imp_personal.py` function Created by me 

It has a many fucntionalities such as 
* Making Markdown comment along with a link which helps to access the topic from top of the page
* And the executed command except `.new()` all will be deleted after Running the cell

`watcher.py` : The name only a watcher but can do a so much

* Watch the changes or created new function (only do something when there is any changes related to functions This i have deleberately chosen.)
* Then make git operations when the file is modified 
* Operations such as
    * `git add`
    * `git commit`
    * `git push`


I will be writing theory explaination , implmentation and problems based on each section as mentioned in the GFG DSA with python course

I will be using **Jupyter Notebook** as IDE

> Note:  so the links which you see at start of any notebook may not be able to open in Github
